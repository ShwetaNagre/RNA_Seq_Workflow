Normalization is a crucial step in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis, aimed at adjusting for technical effects to ensure accurate inference of gene expression levels. This mathematical process helps control for experimental errors while preserving the biological truths inherent in the data.
Key Considerations for Normalizing RNA-Seq Data

## Normalization Methods  

There are several effective normalization methods to consider, each with its unique approach:  

Trimmed Mean of M Values (TMM): A widely-used method that trims away extreme log fold changes to provide a more robust estimate of expression levels.  

DESeq2: This method compares data across samples, making it suitable for identifying differentially expressed genes.  

Quantile Normalization (QN): A cross-sample distribution-based method that ensures the distribution of gene expression levels is the same across samples.  

Relative Log Expression (RLE/DESeq): Another cross-sample distribution method that normalizes based on the relative log expression of genes.  

Median Ratio Normalization (MRN): Similar to RLE, this method uses median ratios across samples to achieve normalization.  


## Control Genes  

Incorporating negative control genes or spike-in controls can enhance the normalization process, providing reference points for adjusting expression levels.

## Data Verification and Validation  

The quality and quantity of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) generated from RNA-seq analyses are highly dependent on the normalization technique employed. Selecting an appropriate method is essential for ensuring reliable results.  

## Normalization Strategies  

Normalization strategies can vary based on:  

Negative Control Genes: Utilizing specific genes known not to change under experimental conditions.  

Negative Control Samples: Including samples that serve as controls to benchmark expression levels.  

Residuals from First-Pass GLM Regression: Employing residuals from generalized linear models as a basis for normalization can also be effective.
